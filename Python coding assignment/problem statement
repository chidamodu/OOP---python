Task 1
1. Write a lesson introducing students to loops. Imagine they're new to coding but know basic Python syntax.
What are loops and why do we need them?
Explain the relevant syntax in Python. Define relevant key terms.

2. Write two related tasks so that students can practice what they've learned. Include the question itself, the solution (and any related code output), and a 
hint that students can refer to if they're stuck.


Task 2
Create the outline of a course introducing future data scientists to supervised learning. Imagine they are already comfortable with Python and know the 
necessary math. This will be their first exposure to machine learning. Indicate what kind of practice tasks you would include.
Explain why you make the choices that you make. Think in terms of relevance to the job market rather than mere technical proficiency.
You don't need to be too detailed; we want to see how well you can break down a general learning goal into concrete steps.

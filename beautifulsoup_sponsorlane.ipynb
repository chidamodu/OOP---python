Whether you are bold and feisty like an Aries, sweet and romantic like a Pisces, or bright and versatile like a Gemini, each bottle of our artisan wine reflects the unique qualities of your sign. <br/>\n",

       "  All of the grapes are from boutique vineyards in Sonoma, Lodi, and Santa Maria Valley in California. Founder, Marie Fox, consulted with her friend and wine expert, Stephen Ansley, a level II Sommelier with extensive experience in wine, craft beer and retail, to identify varietals that evoke the taste of each element. Award winning winemaker, Joseph Smith, of brands such as Old Ghost Zinfandel and Klinker Brick, and fifth generation wine industry veteran, Jeff Hansen, were then brought on to handcraft the perfect wine. <br/>\n",

(Sept. 7, 2016) – Mint Studio opens in Carmel Valley’s new Village at Pacific Highland Ranch, 5965 Village Way, Suite E 105 (92130), Oct. 1. The do-it-yourself (DIY) creativity studio and event space will host crafts, classes and workshops, as well as uniquely curated and customized gifts, parties and events for kids and adults.\\n\\xa0\\nClasses will range from trending topics presented by local artisans, and will introduce the innovative concept of a DIY “Pinterest Studio,” were guests can be inspired by projects and new ideas that change monthly. Mint Studio will also offer drop-off studio for kids, date nights, social gatherings and corporate events.\\n\\xa0\\n“My goal with Mint is to bring creativity and community together to celebrate life’s special\\xa0 moments and connect with family and friends,” said founder and chief creative officer, Jayme Sanders.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe studio will offer Open DIY Studio time. Guests can drop in any time and pick from trending DIY craft projects that change monthly. The studio makes it easy to be creative by providing the tools, materials and support.\\xa0 DIY culture is rooted in a desire for active participation, individual customization and the experiential value.\\xa0 Mint is a gathering space to connect our community in a unique way through the creative process and to find unique gifts and experiences that foster imagination.\\n\\xa0\\nMint Studio also offers a number of Kids Programs, starting at age 3, including preschool, home school and after-school classes. Mint Kids is a creative space for art and science to inspire young minds, supporting sensory art, art therapy, mindful art and yoga, all which develops a creative mind early.\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, the studio is organizing After-School Drop-Off Hours, Mommy and Me Classes, Date Nights, Moms Night Out and other social gatherings.\\n\\xa0\\nThere will also be several Adult Workshops offered monthly, by local artisans and celebrity makers. Light refreshments and music accompany the themed workshops. Some of the upcoming classes include:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCabernet and Calligraphy, Friday, Oct. 14 from 6-8pm; $105\\nPumpkin Succulent Design, Sunday, Oct. 16 from 1-3pm; $55\\nIntro to Watercolor Painting with Artist April Preston, Saturday, Nov. 12 from 10am-1pm; $125\\nHeidi Swapp Minc Basics & Art of Gold Foiling, Saturday, Nov. 19 from 2-5pm; $75\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe DIY industry trend began in the 1970s and has continued its growth based on consumers wanting to gain knowledge, new skills and the enormous feeling of satisfaction that comes from creating it yourself. Generation Y is becoming generation DIY. Now, young adults under the age of 35 dominate the 29 billion dollar crafting industry. Millennials are bringing together technology, creativity and entrepreneurism as they take on more DIY projects.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0“All too often attempts at a gorgeous DIY project do not end up looking like the Pinterest picture,” said Sanders of her inspiration for the studio. “The projects can often be very expensive and involve several trips to the craft store, which for Carmel Valley residents, involves a 20-minute one-way trip to the nearest Michaels. While many of us create beautiful Pinterest boards of projects we would love to someday do, but the time, effort and lack of tools and/or knowledge, prohibit the novice crafter from completing heartfelt projects and the joy that comes from the creative experience.”\\n\\xa0\\nIt is time to stop \"pinning\" and start \"doing\" the latest trending Pinterest projects in a local interactive creativity space where all the supplies, mess and frustration are taken care of. Mint Studio\\'s innovative concept is merging the best of two giants – Pinterest and Etsy – into a local, brick and mortar store, giving customers the ability to create and connect.\\xa0 When kids craft, they develop problem solving skills. They become much better thinkers. And they acquire confidence. Above all, through making, they realize they can do anything they set their mind to.\\n\\xa0\\nMint Studio\\'s collaboration with ETSY local will support local makers in their small business ventures by hosting workshops and craft nights, adding additional revenue streams and connecting makers with their target markets. It also will give the studio access to local talent and allow for a wide range of classes from the latest trending macramé project to creating custom cards on the Cameo Silhouette to wood burning and glass etching. The possibilities are endless.\\xa0 Mint’s concept has also attracted celebrity crafters to schedule special appearances which will allow them to introduce and promote the latest crafting products in the market.\\n\\xa0\\nSanders is a mother to three small children and is in a state of constant research and development between her own children and volunteering in arts and science at their elementary and preschools. She also serves on the board as foundation co-president at Solana Beach School District, which exemplifies her dedication to bringing art and science into the community and local families.\\xa0 She has collaborated with companies that share a passion for creating products and experiences that allow families to imagine, create and play together.\\n\\xa0For more information, visit www.mintstudiosd.com, where San Diegans are encouraged to Create.

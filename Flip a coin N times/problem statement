Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times. Print out tail or head for each flip and let the program count 
and print the number of heads.

Hint. Use r = random.random() and define head as r <= 0.5, or draw an integer among {0,1} 
with r = random.randint(0,1) and define head when r is 0.

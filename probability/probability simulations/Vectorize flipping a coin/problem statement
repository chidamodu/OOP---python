Simulate flipping a coin N times and write out the number of tails. The code should be vectorized, i.e., there must 
be no loops in Python.

Hint. Constructions like numpy.where(r<=0.5, 1, 0) combined with numpy.sum, or r[r<=0.5].size, are useful, where r is 
an array of random numbers between 0 and 1.

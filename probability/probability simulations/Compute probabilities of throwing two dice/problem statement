Throw two dice a large number of times in a program. Record the sum of the eyes each time and count how many times 
each of the possibilities for the sum (2, 3, …, 12) appear. Compute the corresponding probabilities and compare them 
with the exact values. 
(To find the exact probabilities, set up all the 6×6 possible outcomes of throwing two dice, and then count how many 
of them that has a sum s for s=2,3,…,12.)
